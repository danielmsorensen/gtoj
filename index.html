    <h3>Education</h3>
    <p>Since the dawn of time, people have strived to learn, gaining knowledge is an innate urge in the human body, 
    computers and the web which contain the accumulation of human knowledge have made it much more accessible. 
    Websites are consistantly being made to help people, with computers, around the world gain more knowledge.

    <h3>Online Colleges</h3>

    <p>Proof that computers have greatly benefited the educational sector is the fact that the number of students enrolled in online universities cumulates to a total of over 20 million students. Enrolling in online universities allows people from around the world to study and attend their enrolled institutions from their homes, in whichever country they may be residing within. Some drawbacks of this include the student becoming lazy, but this is the fault of the student and should not be blamed on the computer.</p>

    <h2>Environmental aspect of the internet</h2>
    <p>Computers use a lot of power. Even with more and more efficient hardware, the global energy demand of computing is enough to convince many it has a negative effect in terms of carbon emissions and other pollutants. It doesn't help that the trend of increasing computer use shows no sign of stopping.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card-small item">
    <p style="margin-top: 10px">The internet allows for energy-efficient usage for many activities, such as banking online, working with less paper or giving conferences over apps rather than flying around the world. Though many media outlets have been trying to guilt-trip users for accessing the world wide web, it is common sense that digital information done nearly instantly from anywhere, towards anywhere is a much more practical and sustainable practice.

  <div class="card-small item">
    <p style="margin-top: 10px">A pdf of 20 pages sent to 3000 people over the internet is a lot greener than printing 30.000 pages (60.000 if single sided) and mailing them individually. Anyone that claims otherwise is dishonest.</p>
    <p>The internet uses a lot of ressources to be operated, but this does not change the fact that its use is more sustainable than the alternatives.</p>
