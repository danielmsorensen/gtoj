i. Very good
Content was intersting but a little short in some areas

ii. Excellent
The main page looked very good and professional however the other pages did not have the same style
Other pages were not linked to the main page at all

iii. Excellent
Grammar and spelling was good but didn't read well on the other pages

iv. Outstanding
The html was written very well with no syntax rules broken, the only noticable points were some formatting inconsistencies and some bad practices with tags

v. Acceptable
The contributions look uneven from commits and work on certain pages looks lacking from some.
There was no author text only links
