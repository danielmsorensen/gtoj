			<h2>Impact on jobs</h2>
			<p>Rapid technological progress and innovation can threaten employment.Technological innovations can affect employment in two main
ways:<br>
<!-- This should be a <ul> -->
• by directly displacing workers from tasks they were previously
performing (displacement effect)<br>
• by increasing the demand for labour in industries or jobs that arise
or develop due to technological progress (productivity effect).Technology can
replace human labour in routine tasks, whether manual or cognitive,
but (as yet) cannot replace human labour in non-routine tasks. Many argue that the impact of technology leads to rising relative demand in well-paid skilled jobs, which typically require
non-routine cognitive skills, and rising relative demand in low-paid,
least-skilled jobs, which typically require non-routine manual skills.
At the same time, demand for ‘middling’ jobs, which have
typically required routine manual and cognitive skills, will fall.

			<h2>Impact on productivity</h2>
			<p>By 2035, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the power to increase productivity by 40 percent or more, according to Accenture. For manufacturing companies, integrating AI into legacy information and communications systems will deliver significant cost, time and process-related savings quickly. AI improves the manufacturer’s bottom line through intelligent automation, labor and capital augmentation, and innovation diffusion. For example, by analyzing incidents in real time, AI can provide early warning of potential problems and propose alternative solutions. These benefits mean that AI has the potential to boost profitability an average of 38 percent by 2035.</p>
			<h2>Monetary impact</h2>
			<p>Research
launched by consulting company Accenture covering 12 developed economies, which together
generate more than 0.5 % of the world's economic output, forecasts that by 2035, AI could double
annual global economic growth rates. A study by PwC estimates that global GDP may increase by up to 14 %
(the equivalent of US$15.7 trillion) by 2030 as a result of the accelerating development and take-up
of AI.</p>
